# Creating a chart by splitting it into components

---

# No chart is made completely in a single pass

* A chart is not a single element, so don't think of it as one

* Perhaps this thought (single element) may work for standard charts like bar charts, line charts and scatterplots because most software tools provide quick ways of creating them, with _reasonable_ defaults

* What do you do when even a basic chart or a single element is off?

**You split the chart into components**

---

# _Plane_ and _retinal variables_

A **plane** is like the coordinate system that defines how geometries are placed in a space. A **retinal variable** defines how to encode data into visuals.

# The Grammar of Graphics

William S. Cleveland, in his 1994 book _The Elements of Graphing Data_, lists the “basic elements of graph construction” as **scales, captions, plotting symbols, reference lines, keys, labels, panels, and tick marks**.

In _The Grammar of Graphics_, published in 2005, Leland Wilkinson built off the work by Bertin and more formally defined the components of a graphic:

Statistical graphic specifications are expressed in six statements:

>DATA: a set of data operations that create variables from datasets<br/>
TRANS: variable transformation (e.g. rank)<br/>
SCALE: scale transformations (e.g. log)<br/>
COORD: a coordinate system (e.g. polar)<br/>
ELEMENT: graphs (e.g. points) and their aesthetic attributes (e.g. color)<br/>
GUIDE: one or more guides (axes, legends, etc.)

**Hadley Wickham implemented Wilkinson’s grammar in R with the popular `ggplot2` package.**

# Strategies for breaking charts into individual components

* The **data** drives all decisions
* The **visual encodings** dictate the geometry and/or colors of a graphic
* The **coordinate system** (Cartesian, polar, or geographic) specifies the space in which the visual encodings reside
* The **context** communicates what the data is about, where it is from, and why it exists.
