### 1) Check the data

* This should be obvious
* If your data is weak, your chart is weak
* Start with simple graphs to see if there are any outliers

### 2) Explain encodings

* Provide a legend
* Label shapes
* Explain color scales

### 3) Label axes

* Axes without labels or explanation are just decoration
* Describe the scale (incremental, exponential, logarithmic?)
* Have axes values start at zero

### 4) Include units

* Numbers without units are meaningless
* Remove the guesswork

### 5) Keep your geometry in check

* This is something that is immediately noticeable
* Don't use area to compare two units unless they are an area. An increase in a unit squares the area.
* Tip: size circles and other 2D shapes by area, unless it's a bar chart

### 6) Include your sources

* This is another obvious one
* Always include the source of your data
* Makes your graphic more reputable
* Allows for others to dig deeper

### 7) Consider your audience

* What purpose do your charts have and who are they for?
* Avoid quirky fonts
* Make good design choices
