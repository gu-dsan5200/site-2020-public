# A _very_ short history of data visualization

---

- Astronomical data presentation for navigation
- 1700s: Rene Descartes
- 1800-1900: Graphs and pie charts (WilliamPlayfair)
- 1913: Iowa State University: Introduced some of the first courses in “graphing” data 1. 1977: Princeton University:
- Statistics Professor John Tukey Developed the first exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- 1983: Edward Tufte published “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” which showed effective visualization methods.
- 1984, Apple Computer introduced the first popular and affordable computer that focused in graphics (GIU) as a mode of interaction and display. This was huge and persists today.
- 1999: The words, “information visualization” were so first named in the book: “Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think”, Card, Mackinlay, Shneiderman.
- Around 2000ish - : In Few’s opinion, the IBM PC detracted from the value of making graphs by hand as it offers a mouse and computer-application based option. When people made graphs by hand, the took the time to be responsible.

# Evolution of computing visualization tools

- Hand drawn
- 1970s: CAD/CAM
- 1980s: Scientific visualization, business visualizations (Harvard Graphics)
- 1990s: Excel, Powerpoint, R
- 2000s: Open source, interactive, web
