# Software

We will mainly use two scripting languages in this course: 
[R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org). In particular, we will make heavy use of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) group of packages and its philosophy in R, and Python packages in the [PyData ecosystem](https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html), primarily `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`. Several other packages in both R and Python will be introduced as needed. 

We will also use [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), a popular data visualization software.

# Other useful software (not required)

1. Adobe Illustrator / Inkscape
1. Adobe Photoshop / GIMP
1. Adobe Reader Pro / Preview
1. ImageMagick (accessible via the R package `magick`)

## Online Porfolio

You will create an online presence via a hosted website. In this portfolio, you will showcase the work you have done in this class. Several of the homework assignments will be a part of your portfolio, as well as the final project. 


## Final Project

You will create an R Markdown dashboard using the `flexdashboard` package to visualize data sets in at least 3 ways and to create a visual narrative. This dashboard will also be a part of the online portfolio, but it is an separate assignment.

# Collaboration Policy

* **All individual work is by definition, INDIVIDUAL. We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for cheating and not doing individual work when required. Homeworks, Online Portfolio, and the Final Project are ALL INDIVIDUAL.**
* If an assignment deliverable looks too similar another one (or more) then the grade will be divided among all students whose work is similar.
* You can, and should, work together on the asynchronous online discussions.
